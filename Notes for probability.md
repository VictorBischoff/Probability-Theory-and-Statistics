## Symbols and formulas:

### Binomial Distribution
$$n: \text{number of trials}$$
$$p: \text{probability of success eg. } 1$$
$$q: \text{probability of failure eg. } 0$$
$$x/k: \text{desired number of successes}$$
$$
\binom{n}{x}=\frac{n!}{(n-x)! \cdot x!}
$$
$$P(X = x)= \binom{n}{x} \cdot p^{x} \cdot q^{n-x}$$

$$mean: \mu = n\cdot p$$
$$std. dev: \sqrt {n \cdot p \cdot q}$$

## Examples:

### Binomial Distribution
Roll a die 4 times, and 2 times it must be a 1:
$n=4$  | $p=\frac{1}{6}$ | $q=\frac{5}{6}$ | $x/k=2$ | $X \sim B(4,\frac{1}{6})$ 
$$P(X=2)=\binom{4}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{2} \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right) ^{4-2}$$
$$P(X=2)=6 \cdot 0,0277 \cdot 0,694$$
$$P(X=2)=0,1153428$$
